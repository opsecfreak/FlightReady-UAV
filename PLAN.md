# FlightReady UAV Platform Plan

## Vision
Create a unified UAV operations platform that guides pilots, flight crews, and program managers through every stage of mission readiness. The system combines customizable checklists, fleet management tools, and compliance documentation so operators can safely launch from any device—web browser, Android app, or third-party integrations via API.

## Target Users
- Individual recreational pilots
- Part 107 commercial operators and crews
- Fleet managers coordinating multiple UAVs and pilots
- Enterprise safety officers and compliance managers

## Core Objectives
1. Ensure pilots complete comprehensive pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight checklists tailored to each aircraft.
2. Maintain an auditable log of flights, maintenance actions, and compliance activities.
3. Support cross-platform access with a consistent, responsive interface.
4. Provide extensibility for integrations (weather, airspace, telemetry, asset management).

## Functional Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Minimum Viable Product
- **User Authentication & Roles**: Email/password and OAuth login; roles for Pilot, Crew Chief, Safety Manager.
- **Drone Registry**: Users add drones with name, FAA/UAV registration number, weight category, and custom tags.
- **Checklist Builder**: Preloaded templates by drone category; users can customize steps per aircraft; conditional steps based on weather, location, or payload.
- **Mission Planning**: Create missions with date, location, airspace class, weather snapshot, and assigned crew.
- **Pre-Flight Workflow**: Guided checklist completion with digital sign-off and optional photo attachments.
- **Compliance Log**: Auto-generate flight readiness report (PDF/export) and store in mission history.

### Phase 2 — Operational Enhancements
- **Weather & Airspace Integrations**: Pull real-time weather (OpenWeather) and FAA UAS Facility Map advisories; alert for TFRs and NOTAMs.
- **Maintenance Tracking**: Log inspections, firmware updates, battery cycles, and component replacements; schedule upcoming maintenance.
- **Inventory & Equipment Checks**: Track ground support gear (controllers, batteries, payloads) with checklists and availability.
- **Crew Coordination**: Shared mission calendar, shift scheduling, and chat/notifications.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Flight hours by drone/pilot, incident trends, compliance metrics.

### Phase 3 — Advanced Capabilities
- **Live Ops API**: Webhooks and REST/GraphQL APIs for importing telemetry, updating mission status, or integrating with ERP/asset systems.
- **Geofencing & Risk Assessment**: Upload mission plans (KML/GeoJSON), calculate risk scores based on population density, obstacles, and weather.
- **Incident Reporting**: Post-flight anomaly capture, corrective actions, and regulatory reporting templates.
- **Offline Mode**: Enable Android app to run checklists without connectivity and sync once online.
- **White-Label & Multi-Tenant Support**: Allow organizations to manage multiple teams/brands in a single deployment.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security**: Role-based access control, encrypted storage for sensitive data, audit logs.
- **Performance**: Responsive UI (<200ms interactions) and scalable back-end to support fleets of 100+ drones.
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime target with automated backups and disaster recovery.
- **Compliance**: Align with FAA Part 107 documentation standards; support custom regulatory requirements per region.

## Deployment Strategy
- **Web**: Progressive Web App served from a CDN with edge caching.
- **Android**: Native wrapper using Kotlin + Jetpack Compose or React Native module targeting Android; share logic via TypeScript/React Native or Kotlin Multiplatform.
- **API**: Deploy stateless services via container orchestration (Kubernetes) with autoscaling; expose REST/GraphQL endpoints.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for testing, linting, build pipelines; automated deployments to staging/production.

## Data Model Highlights
- **Users**: Profiles, roles, certifications, contact info.
- **Drones**: Metadata (name, registration ID, weight, category, maintenance logs).
- **Missions**: Location, date/time, assigned crew, associated drone, checklist status, exports.
- **Checklists**: Templates, steps, conditional logic, attachments.
- **Equipment**: Inventory, inspection dates, battery health.
- **Logs**: Flight records, incidents, maintenance events.

## API Surface (High-Level)
- `/auth/*`: Authentication and authorization endpoints.
- `/drones`: CRUD for drone registry, including attachments and maintenance logs.
- `/missions`: Mission planning, assignment, and status updates.
- `/checklists`: Template management, conditional logic, completion records.
- `/weather`: Proxy to external weather/airspace data with caching.
- `/reports`: Generate PDFs/CSV exports for compliance and analytics.
- `/integrations/webhooks`: Inbound/outbound events for telemetry or enterprise systems.

## Cross-Platform Experience
- **Responsive Layout**: Tailwind CSS + component library for consistent look; offline caching for field use.
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance; voice-assisted checklist progression.
- **Localization**: Multi-language support with i18n framework.
- **Notifications**: Push notifications (web/mobile) for mission updates, maintenance alerts.

## Success Metrics
- Reduction in incomplete checklist submissions.
- Increase in compliance-ready flight reports delivered on time.
- User satisfaction scores (NPS) for pilots and managers.
- Adoption of API integrations by enterprise clients.

## Implementation Sequencing
1. Set up monorepo structure (Nx/Turborepo) with shared TypeScript packages for models, validation, and API clients.
2. Scaffold back-end API with authentication, drone registry, and mission endpoints.
3. Build responsive PWA with initial checklist workflows and mission dashboard.
4. Create React Native Android app leveraging shared components; implement offline checklist mode.
5. Expose external API endpoints and webhook support; publish developer documentation.
6. Integrate advanced analytics, maintenance scheduling, and risk assessment tools.
7. Harden infrastructure with monitoring, automated compliance reporting, and DR drills.

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Regulatory changes**: Modularize checklist templates by region; maintain update schedule.
- **Data reliability**: Cache weather/airspace data; provide manual override with audit trail.
- **Offline usage**: Ensure conflict resolution strategy for syncing checklist completions.
- **Security**: Perform regular penetration tests; enforce MFA and least privilege access.
